      <h3>Description:</h3>Wedges are the highest lofted clubs in your bag. They are also some of the shortest clubs. You get the most spin with your wedges so you can stop the ball on the green.

      <h3>Where to use them:</h3> You usually use wedges when you are close to the green or you need to go a short distance. Wedges can be used for layups or to punch out of tough spots. Wedges are great for chipping around the green and when you are in greenside bunkers.
