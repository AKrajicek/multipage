      <h3>Description:</h3>Irons are the most versatile clubs in the bag. It is easier to
      shape a shot with an iron than almost any other club. Irons also take up
      more of your bag than any other club, with most bags having at least 5-6
      irons.

      <h3>Where to use them:</h3> You can use an Iron from pretty much anywhere. They are
      perfect in the fairways and rough. You can use them near the green if you
      go for a bump and run. You use them on the tee for most par 3's.
