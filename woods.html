    <p><h3>Most common types of woods:</h3> Driver, 3 wood, and 5 wood</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      <h3>Description:</h3> Woods are the longest club in the bag. Both literally and in
      the sense that they go the furthest. Woods used to be actually made out of
      wood but are now made of different metals.

    <p>
      <h3>Where to use them:</h3> You would usually use them on the tee or in the
      fairway. It is harder to hit a wood from the rough or in tough lies.
